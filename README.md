"Oh you should put this kind of stuff on github!!"

Anyways this is just me messing around and learning how to use java for game development instead of algorithms and other things that make me fall asleep.

So, nothing to see here, move along. I guess the only thing you'd come here for is to tell me that I'm doing it wrong which I would appriciate as it would help me do better in the future.

Have a good day.
